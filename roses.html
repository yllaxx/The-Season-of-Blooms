        <p style="font-size: 36px; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Discover the Timeless Beauty of Tulips</p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Tulips, with their vibrant colors and elegant shapes, have captivated people for centuries, 
           earning them a special place in gardens, art, and cultural symbolism. These beautiful flowers
           belong to the genus Tulipa and are native to Central Asia, particularly in regions stretching 
           from Turkey to the Himalayas. Tulips have a rich history that intertwines with human civilization. 
           They were first cultivated by the Turks in the Ottoman Empire during the 10th century. Tulips became 
           highly prized and were often depicted in art, textiles, and ceramics, symbolizing wealth and prosperity. 
           Their popularity soared, leading to a period known as the "Tulip Mania" in the 17th century Netherlands, 
           where tulip bulbs became a form of currency and were traded at exorbitant prices, eventually resulting in
            a market crash. This event remains one of the most famous economic bubbles in history.</p>
